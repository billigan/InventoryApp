# InventoryApp
This is my project for Java 1 -- WGU C482. 
This is a very basic, simple inventory app that lets you add parts and products that I built for my Java 1 class at Western Governors University. 
This is a JavaFX app built using scenebuilder.
I built it using NetBeans as the code editor, but I removed my nbproject folder.
